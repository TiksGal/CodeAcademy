# Create a dataclass named "Product" that has the following attributes:
#     product_id: int
#     name: str
#     price: float
#     quantity: int
# The class should also have a method named "total_cost" that calculates and returns the total cost of the product, which is the price multiplied by the quantity.
# Create a list of Product objects and write a function that takes this list as input and returns the product with the highest total cost.
# Write a program that creates a list of 5 Product objects, prints out their attributes, and then calls the function to find the product with the highest total cost.
