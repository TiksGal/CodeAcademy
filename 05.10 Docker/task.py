# Google is launching a network of autonomous pizza delivery drones and wants you to create 
# a flexible rewards system (Pizza Pointsâ„¢) that can be tweaked in the future.
# The rules are simple: if a customer has made at least N orders of at least Y price, they get a FREE pizza!
# Create a function that takes a dictionary of customers, a minimum number of orders and a minimum order price. 
# Return a list of customers that are eligible for a free pizza.
